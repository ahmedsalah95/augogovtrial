# Graduation project

## Project idea

* It’s a business process automation and performance enhancement that works on making it fast, effective and efficient.
* This process is the governmental legal paper affairs. That it is, it’s a business process management and development domain.

## Problem significance

* The problem is the inefficiency and repetition in the different process stages. This is due to bottlenecks that exist because of human resources dependencies, for example, there is only one person who do specific task in the process who may slow down the whole process, worse than that is the nontransparent process that does not allow to figure out where does the problem or the bottlenecks are, so this solution will bring up this process automation, transparency, and efficiency that will make it fast and easy for bottlenecks discovery.

## System basic functional requirements

The system actually can be partitioned into 3 parts, Adding and configuring system settings, issuing requests, and requests tracking and monitoring.

* ### Configuring system settings

    First of all, this part is for managing system users and privileges and groups. Then, transaction types are created and associating each with the required ordered steps, fees, and documents. Since most of the transactions are based on addresses, so that address structuring is well designed to be maintainable and effectively searchable. Also, every transaction is access controlled by the access control manager and user groups to specify who can do what.

* ### Issuing requests

    After configuring the system, now the system is ready to be used for issuing different types of requests. Employees can start the request and following the required steps, documents and fees specified while configuring the transactions, clients can easily issue any legal paper or license.

* ### Request tracking and monitoring

    Clients can track requests via mobile app step by step and see status descriptions. Employees can monitor the request for any bottlenecks via dashboards to prevent any possible delays.

## What is actually implemented

Since we invest our time in the problem definition and designing a general system for different types of legal papers, it took us a lot of time to do so, it's a 70 relation or like so ERD document, so yes, it took so much time. Hence, the implementation phase included almost 70% of the first functional part discussed before, the system configuration part, almost 50% of the requests issuing part, and 20% of the request tracking and monitoring part. We haven't invested so much time in user interface design.
